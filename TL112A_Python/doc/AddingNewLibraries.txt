Adding New Libraries
========================================================================================================================
It is common to need to add new libraries to the Python component to support tool components.  The libraries should be
added as zip files rather than folder structures.  The core library has been modified to include a step that will
automatically unzip the libraries on the first run.


This has a number of benefits, including:

- Reduced Synergy transfer times (a few large files rather than thousands of tiny files).
- Easier to see changes in compare view in Synergy.
    - Currently it shows hundreds of changed files at a time which are impossible to review.


When adding a new library use the following steps as a guide.

1. Copy the library folder into include folder of TL112A.
2. Run ZipLib.py against the library folder to convert it into an archive.
3. Remove all folders from the include directory (including the new library).
4. Check changes into Synergy.


The same process applies for updating a library.


The first time any script is run, the modified site.py script will automatically unzip all of the *.zip files into the
include directory for and append that directory to the sys.path variable for use by scripts via regular "import"
statements.
